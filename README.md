**Description:**  
Learning Go (Made by Google) by test-driven examples to promote test-driven development (=TTD). TDD emphasizes the importance of an effective and sustainable testing approach. TDD also contributes directly to the overall quality of software. It’s a truism for small or large system development that often goes missing in the day-to-day hustle to get new functionality into production. Quality software gets built when there’s an acknowledgment that quality test code should receive the same amount of attention and resources as quality production code, as they are equally essential in development.
  
### What We Learned (so far..)
* Test driven design with GO

**Chapter 1**
  
* Writing tests
* Declaring functions, with arguments and return types
* "if", "const" and "switch"
* Declaring variables and constants

**Chapter 2**
* More practice of the TDD workflow
* "Integers", "addition"
* Writing better documentation so users of our code can understand its usage quickly
* Examples of how to use our code, which are checked as part of our tests

**Chapter 3**
* More TDD practice
* Learned "for"
* Learned how to write benchmarks

**Chapter 4**
* Arrays
* Slices
* The various ways to make them
* How they have a fixed capacity but you can create new slices from old ones
* using append
* How to slice, slices
* len to get the length of an array or slice
* Test coverage tool
* reflect.DeepEqual and why it's useful but can reduce the type-safety of your code

**Chapter 5**
* Declaring structs to create your own data types which lets you bundle related data together and make the intent of your code clearer
* Declaring interfaces so you can define functions that can be used by different types (parametric polymorphism)
* Adding methods so you can add functionality to your data types and so you can implement interfaces
* Table driven tests to make your assertions clearer and your test suites easier to extend & maintain
